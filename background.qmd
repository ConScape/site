[Panzacchi et al. 2015](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12386) shows the first application of the randomized shortest paths framework in combination with step selection functions.

[Van Moorter et al. 2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ecog.05351) presents a framework to scale up step selection functions to assess effective connectivity using the randomized shortest paths framework. This paper presents an extensive discussion of the RSP in an ecological context.

[Van Moorter et al. 2022](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13850) is the core publication of the ConScape library, and should be cited for the library.
