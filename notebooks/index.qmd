Here I will present an annotated index of the different notebooks through a short summary.

The first Notebook on how [getting started](/notebooks/nbk_getting_started.qmd) with ConScape is a prerequisite for all subsequent Notebooks.

From here we recommend you look at the Notebook on [performance](/notebooks/nbk_landmarks.qmd) as this introduces the concept of 'landmarks', which are used throughout the other Notebooks to improve performance.

The next Notebook on different [ecological distance](/notebooks/nbk_distance_metrics.qmd) metrics builds upon the ideas presented in [@vanmoorter2021defining].

The next Notebook details different ways to measure [functional habitat](/notebooks/nbk_functionality_variants.qmd).

Finally, the Notebook on [dispersal mortality](/notebooks/nbk_cost.qmd) uses the ConScape library for applications similar to those presented in [@fletcher2019towards] and [@vanmoorter2021defining], where the probability and cost of movement are potentially independent processes.
