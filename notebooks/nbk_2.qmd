This notebook assumes familiarity with the basics as covered in the "getting started" [notebook](/notebooks/nbk_getting_started.qmd)

In this first notebook we demonstrate the basic workflow as presented in van Moorter et al. (2022) 
to compute the amount of connected habitat and the movement flow in four steps:
1. data import and Grid creation;
2. computation of the GridRSP;
3. computation of the amount of connected habitat;
4. movement flow in two variants (weighted by quality or by proximity).
