In other words: "which level of randomness for the paths between source and target?"

A difficult question... First, testing different values of $\theta$ will allow you to assess the sensitivity of your results to this crucial parameter. Furthermore, several efforts exist to estimate $\theta$ from movement data, for instance: [Kivim√§ki et al. 2020](https://academic.oup.com/comnet/article-abstract/8/4/cnaa024/5989563), and [Panzacchi et al. 2015](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2656.12386).
