After several years of hard work, in April 22, 2022, we published the ConScape library in Methods in Ecology and Evolution [here](https://besjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/2041-210X.13850). We are now developing a website to serve users with updates and supplementary information based on feedback we are receiving. So, please, get in touch for questions, issue, etc.
