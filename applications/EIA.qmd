::: {.callout-note}
Assessment of impact of anthropogenic infrastructures for wild reindeer habitat loss and fragmentation.
:::

[Dorber et al. 2023](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13280-022-01824-x) presents a first application of functional habitat to the assessment of the impact of hydropower on wild reindeer in Norway. 

Go [here](https://sites.google.com/view/reindeermapsnorway/) for an application of ConScape for reindeer habitat assessments, including interactive web maps in the [Google Earth Engine](https://earthengine.google.com/): 

- [Wild reindeer maps](https://bramvanmoorter.users.earthengine.app/view/renewablereindeergis): where you can explore maps produced using analytical approaches to illustrate how reindeer view the landscape in terms of suitable resources, functional areas, corridors, barriers, and human footprint,

- [Comparison with expert-based maps](https://bramvanmoorter.users.earthengine.app/view/qualitynorm): where you can compare maps produced using analytical approaches (using also ConScape) to maps produced through expert assessment for the Norwegian Wild Reindeer Quality Norm assessment - Delnorm 3.
