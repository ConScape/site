Hence, using the notebooks provided here will get anybody with a background in other programming languages started right away.

We will follow this with great interest.\n\n\n## Installation ConScape\n\nTo install ConScape from Julia's package manager:\n\n```julia-repl\n(v1.6) pkg> add ConScape\n```\n\nor easier, directly from Julia:\n\n```julia-repl\njulia> using Pkg\njulia> Add.pkg(\"ConScape\")\njulia> using ConScape\n```\n\n## From here...\n\nNow you are ready to start with the first [notebook](/notebooks/nbk_getting_started.qmd) presenting a basic workflow for connectivity analysis using ConScape.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"wrap","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"quick_start.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.269","theme":{"light":"flatly","dark":"darkly"},"code-copy":true,"title":"Quick start"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
